# ProsperWorks-Ruby

A lightweight wrapper for interacting with the [ProsperWorks Developer API](https://www.prosperworks.com/developer_api).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soccernee/prosperworks-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soccernee/prosperworks-ruby)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prosperworks-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install prosperworks-ruby

## Usage

This gem offers basic operations to interact with the ProsperWorks Developer API. There is minimal error handling and no validation logic.

To use the proper credentials, the following must be run before using the gem:

```
ProsperWorks.configure do |config|
  config.user_email = <your_user_email>
  config.access_token = <your_api_token>
end
```

### Create

```
person = ProsperWorks::Person.create(attributes)

opportunity = ProsperWorks::Opportunity.create({
  pipeline_id: <some_id>,
  company_id: <another_id>,
  monetary_value: 1_000
})

```

### Find

```
person = ProsperWorks::Person.find(id)

lead = ProsperWorks::Lead.find(423)
```

### Update

For update, either update the object in advance:

```
person.name = "A New Name"
response = ProsperWorks::Person.update(person)
```

or pass in a hash of attributes to update:

```
attributes = {
  name: "A New Name"
}
response = ProsperWorks::Person.update(person, attributes)

```

### Delete

```
response = ProsperWorks::Person.delete(person.id)

```
### Search

```
response = ProsperWorks::Person.search(name: "John Doe")
```

### List

```
webhooks = ProsperWorks::Webhook.list
```

The following entity types are currently supported for create, find, update, delete and search:
* Person
* Lead
* Company
* Opportunity
* Task
* Project

The following entity types are currently supported for list:
* Customer Source
* Pipeline
* Pipeline Stage
* Webhook
* CustomFieldDefinition

The response will either be an instance of `ProsperWorks::Errors`, or the entity itself. See the `handle_response` function in [connect.rb](lib/prosperworks/api_operations/connect.rb).
